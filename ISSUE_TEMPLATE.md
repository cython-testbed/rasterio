WELCOME ABOARD!

Hi and welcome to the Rasterio project. We appreciate bug reports, questions
about documentation, and suggestions for new features. This issue template
isn't intended to ward you off; only to intercept and redirect one particular
category of reports, and to collect a few important facts that issue reporters
often omit.

You think you've found something? We believe you.

Please note: Rasterio contains extension modules and is thus susceptible to
C library compatibility issues. If you are reporting an installation or module
import issue, please note that this project only accepts reports about problems
with packages downloaded from the Python Package Index. Conda users should take
issues to one of the following trackers:

- https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues
- https://github.com/conda-forge/rasterio-feedstock
